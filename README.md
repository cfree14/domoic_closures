This is the GitHub repository for a project to build visualizations of closures and management restrictions in US West Coast fisheries. It is currently focused on the Dungeness crab fishery and domoic acid and whale entanglement closures but it would be awesome to expand to the other fisheries experiencing HAB related closures: recreational/commercial spiny lobster, recreational bivalves, recreational/commercial rock crab, recreational Dungeness crab.

Specifically, the repo creates the following visualization of closures and management restrictions in the commercial Dungeness crab fishery:
